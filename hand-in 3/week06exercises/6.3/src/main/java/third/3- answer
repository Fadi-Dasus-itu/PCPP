for the array: we added the final keyword that Guarantees visibility and Safe initialization fore the array object
for the total variable: we added the volatile keyword to ensure visibility for the reading operation in the getTotal method,
otherwise we must use the lock in the getTotal method to ensure reading the value from the main memory.

the getSpan method does not need synchronization since the array is declared final which ensure visibility without synchronization and it is read only operation
hence there are no race conditions to guard from. So, final ensure that the array.length is read from the main memory.
