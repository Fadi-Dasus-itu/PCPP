on line 11 we are creating an observable of type that produces the array ("A", "AB", "ABC") on at a time
we specify the subscriber to be three threads from a fixed thread pool (3)
any thread can receive an event from the observable, and finally we will faltmap the result from them all
since we have a delay explicitly in the subscriber "getLengthWithDelay" method all the thread will
get chance to receive one of the events
the first thread get "A" and print Item length 1
the second thread get "AB" and print Item length 2
the third thread get "ABC" and print Item length 3
