7.1: all methods are implemented:
increment and getAndClear are thread safe since variable update happens through CAS non-blocking operation
 by verifying that we have an updated version of the variable before updating it.
getBins, getSpan: are thread safe since they are read only operation and the final key word guarantee that we have an updated version of the array
from the main memory. Thus, we are always reading an updated version of the array.
